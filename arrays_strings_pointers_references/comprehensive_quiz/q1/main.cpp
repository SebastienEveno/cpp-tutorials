/*Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player 
can hold 3 types of items: health potions, torches, 
and arrows. Create an enum to identify the different 
types of items, and an std::array to store the number of each
item the player is carrying (The enumerators are used as indexes
of the array). The player should start with 2 health potions,
5 torches, and 10 arrows. 
Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns 
how many items the player has in total. Have your main()
function print the output of countTotalItems() as well as
the number of torches.*/
